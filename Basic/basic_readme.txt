Report:

Everything worked as expected for the basic part of the traffic controller implementation. We included the testbench,
used to test our code, as well as screenshots of the wave form viewer and transcript when running the testbench.
There are in total (for the basic implementation part) 16 screenshots:
	- 8 screenshots of the waveform viewer (each 30,000 ps apart from each other in the tb)
	- 8 screenshots of the transcript (each 30,000 ps apart from each other in the tb).

They are numbered in sequence, and with respect to other type of screenshot, meaning that basic_waveform_1.PNG 
corresponds to the same time frame as basic_transcript_1.PNG.
